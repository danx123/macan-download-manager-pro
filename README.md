## 🧠 Internal Architecture

This application is built on the principles of modularity and event-drivenness:
- **Model / View / Controller (Qt MVC)** — a clear separation between data, logic, and display.
- **Threaded Worker System** — each download process runs independently on its own thread.
- **Signal-Slot Mechanism** — real-time communication between components for lag-free progress updates.
